## Minecraft Dot csv to txt

This program is meant to convert a csv file obtained from [minecraft-dot.pictures](https://www.minecraft-dot.pictures/) into a more readable format.
Each row of the file will be written as a list of the necessary blocks alongside their quantity and relative position within the row.
It also has a minimal graphical interface that allows to choose conversion language and save the result in a txt file.

[example.csv](example.csv) comes from the conversion of the gen 4 Garchomp sprite using Minecraft Dot website and [result.txt](result.txt) shows how a conversion would look like.

Position of rows and blocks are intended as the same of the csv file, from top to bottom, left to right: the starting point of each row is the leftmost point of it, while row 1 is the topmost one.
